When you think of SEO strategy, the first thing that pops into your mind is content, right? You think about [writing good, relevant content](https://digivijay.in/how-to-improve-page-content-for-seo-rankings/) that is useful for your readers and that will get you oodles of traffic.

So, you sit down, start pitter-pattering on the keyboard and voila, 4 hours later, you have a superb article with well-researched information, edited expertly, ready to be shared with the world. With great enthusiasm, you publish it on your website, 100% sure that this article will generate bucket loads of traffic. However, the results aren’t what you expected. People are reading your article but not staying on the page for long. There’s traffic, but not as much. Why do you think this happened?

One of the main reasons why your content is not giving the results you want is because of the type of content you’ve provided, not the content itself. In this day and age when people’s attention span is decreasing, it makes no sense to provide information that takes more than a minute to read.

Now, there is nothing wrong with long-form content. [Google loves it](https://neilpatel.com/blog/why-you-need-to-create-evergreen-long-form-content-and-how-to-produce-it/). But there is also a reason why platforms such as Instagram and Pinterest are so popular. It’s because they provide the same information in a more attractive and interesting format i.e. through visuals.

> ***65% of people retain information better if it is paired with a relevant image.***

Isn’t that fascinating?

By incorporating visuals through images and infographics in your posts, you can engage more readers and attract better traffic.

### Now, what is an infographic?

An infographic is a visual representation of content. Simply put, it is an ‘information graphic’. It is a combination of images and text that simplifies a message and conveys it to your audience quickly.

Infographics provide an interesting way to transform boring content into visual chunks that a reader can easily consume and retain. By providing information in visual servings, you enable users to remember it and, in turn, make them return to your site.

> ***55%of users spend less than 15 seconds reading content on a page.***

To put it bluntly, **no one has the time to read your long-form content**. Even if it took you hours to put it together, all that matters to your readers is how interesting or engaging your content is.

And infographics are the means to provide interesting and engaging content.

### Why infographics should be part of your SEO strategy?

**Because your biology says so:** The brain processes visual information **60,000 times** faster than text. It implies that you are far more likely to read, remember, and retain information if it is presented visually.

**Because they are great storytelling aids:** People are interested in stories, not statistics. The story behind your data is what matters to them. By using infographics, you can bring your data to life and express it visually, which people will gladly absorb.

**Because they can be linked and shared:** Infographics are liked and shared 3 times more than any other type of content. Sharing will earn you links from different sites, which positively affects your SEO strategy.

**Because they help you rank in search engines:** Isn’t this what all your infographic SEO strategy boils down to? Getting your website or blog ranked in the top results of search engines? When used with other elements, infographics can put your content on page 1 of Google or Bing.

Looking at the image above, I can easily say that you will remember at least 2 of the 4 statistics in there. Even if you didn’t read the text, the numbers will be there in your mind.

### How to create an SEO-friendly infographic?

Creating an infographic does not require over-the-top graphic design skills; it needs meticulous analysis and planning. By investing your time wisely in researching and designing the infographic, you can reap rich rewards in the form of traffic and user engagement.

1.  **Research your content:** Your infographic should provide users new, useful content that they cannot find elsewhere. By providing original content, you increase your chances of being recognized by popular bloggers, content creators, and other marketers.

2.  **Define your audience:** You can design an infographic well if you know who the target audience is. For example, if you want to target corporate honchos, using funny vectors may not help. Likewise, if you are providing information to college students, don’t make its tone too serious.

3.  **Determine information flow:** Create a compelling narrative that will hold your readers’ attention rather than simply putting together a set of images and content. Your infographic should tell a story, not sell a product.

4.  **Make a blueprint:** Before you start designing, determine where each element of your infographic will go i.e. create a blueprint of your design. This will help you understand the flow of information and allows you to revise the design as required.

5.  **Design the infographic:** The final step is to use the tools and resources at your disposal to design the infographic. Many online applications can be used to create infographics. You can also utilize the services of a graphic designer to develop your infographic.
